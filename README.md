# GlucoKit
An IoT (Internet of Things) based first aid kit is a revolutionary device that combines the traditional functions of a first aid kit with modern technology. With the ability to check blood BPM (beats per minute) and SPO2 (blood oxygen saturation level), this first aid kit can provide valuable insights into a person's health. Additionally, the ability to upload this data to the cloud allows for easy storage and accessibility, as well as the potential for remote monitoring by healthcare professionals. This advanced first aid kit has the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of first aid treatment, particularly in emergency situations.
